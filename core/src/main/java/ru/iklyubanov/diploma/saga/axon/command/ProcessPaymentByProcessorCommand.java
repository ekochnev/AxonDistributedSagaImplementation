/**
 * Step 2: YapStone to Payment Processor

 YapStone sends the transaction details to our payment processor using a dedicated link thatâ€™s monitored 24 x 7 x 365
 to ensure that processing is not interrupted.

 Step 3: Payment Processor to Card Networks to Card Issuing Bank

 Payment details are validated by the payment processor by sending them through the credit or debit card networks
 (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover), which forward them to the card-issuing bank to be authorized.
